  <h2>#1 Death Note</h2>

  <img 
    src="images/death-note.jpg" 
    alt="Death Note anime showing Light Yagami slowly becoming evil through absolute power"
    loading="lazy"
  >

  <p>
    Death Note is the definitive anime example of a protagonist who slowly transforms into a villain.
    Light Yagami begins the story as an intelligent, disciplined student who genuinely believes the world
    is rotten and deserves to be purified. When he discovers the Death Note, his initial goal feels almost noble:
    eliminate criminals and create a safer society.
  </p>

  <p>
    What makes Light’s descent so disturbing is how gradual it is.
    He doesn’t snap overnight. Instead, each kill makes the next one easier.
    The more power he gains, the more justified he feels, and morality slowly turns into arrogance.
    Light stops seeing himself as human and starts viewing himself as a god whose judgment cannot be questioned.
  </p>

  <p>
    The psychological battle between Light and L is where the anime truly shines.
    Light lies, manipulates, and sacrifices anyone who stands in his way — including innocent people.
    What’s terrifying is that he never believes he’s evil.
    In his mind, every horrific act is necessary for a “greater good.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Death Note forces viewers to confront an uncomfortable question:
    how much evil can be justified if the outcome seems positive?
    By the end, Light is no longer a hero trying to save the world —
    he is the very monster he once claimed to fight.

  <h2>#2 Code Geass</h2>

  <img 
    src="images/code-geass.jpg" 
    alt="Code Geass anime featuring Lelouch Lamperouge turning into a calculated anti-hero"
    loading="lazy"
  >

  <p>
    Lelouch Lamperouge is one of anime’s most complex protagonists, blurring the line
    between hero, anti-hero, and villain. His story begins with a righteous goal:
    overthrow the oppressive Britannian Empire and create a peaceful world for his sister.
    When Lelouch gains the power of Geass, he finally has the means to challenge an entire nation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike typical villains, Lelouch is fully aware that his actions are morally questionable.
    He uses manipulation, mind control, and mass sacrifice as strategic tools.
    Each victory brings him closer to his goal — but also pushes him further away from his humanity.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tragedy of Lelouch’s character lies in his willingness to become evil if it means achieving peace.
    He accepts hatred, infamy, and bloodshed as the cost of revolution.
    Over time, the weight of his decisions isolates him, turning him into the very tyrant he despised.
  </p>

  <p>
    Code Geass presents evil not as madness, but as a calculated choice.
    Lelouch’s transformation is painful to watch because it feels logical.
    By the end, he embraces the role of the world’s greatest villain —
    not for power, but so that the world can finally move forward without him.

  <h2>#3 Tokyo Ghoul</h2>

  <img 
    src="images/tokyo-ghoul.jpg" 
    alt="Tokyo Ghoul anime showing Kaneki Ken losing his humanity and embracing darkness"
    loading="lazy"
  >

  <p>
    Tokyo Ghoul tells one of the most tragic transformations in anime history.
    Kaneki Ken starts as a gentle, introverted college student who values books,
    kindness, and human connection. After a brutal accident turns him into a half-ghoul,
    his entire understanding of morality and identity begins to collapse.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike characters who chase power, Kaneki is forced into darkness.
    He is hunted, tortured, and constantly reminded that he no longer belongs
    to the human world. His suffering is not symbolic — it is physical and psychological,
    breaking him piece by piece until the person he once was can no longer survive.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kaneki’s transformation is driven by trauma.
    Each act of violence he commits feels like a survival instinct rather than ambition.
    Over time, empathy turns into numbness, and self-doubt is replaced by ruthless resolve.
    He stops asking whether his actions are right and focuses only on protecting his own.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tokyo Ghoul explores how cruelty creates monsters.
    Kaneki doesn’t become evil because he wants to —
    he becomes evil because the world leaves him no other choice.
    His story is a haunting reminder that morality can shatter under constant suffering.
  </p>

    loading="lazy"
  >

  <p>
    Few anime protagonists undergo a transformation as shocking and controversial
    as Eren Yeager. Attack on Titan begins as a classic revenge story driven by survival
    and the desire for freedom.
  </p>

  <p>
    Early on, Eren is impulsive, emotional, and fiercely protective of humanity.
    His hatred for the Titans feels justified, born from trauma and loss.
    The audience roots for him without hesitation.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the truth about the world is revealed, Eren’s worldview shifts.
    The enemy is no longer simple, and freedom comes at an unbearable cost.
    His decisions become colder, more calculated, and increasingly extreme.
  </p>

  <p>
    What makes Eren’s descent terrifying is its inevitability.
    He doesn’t snap — he adapts. Each choice pushes him further away
    from the boy he once was, until the line between hero and villain disappears.

  <h2>#5 Parasyte: The Maxim</h2>

  <img

    alt="Parasyte anime showing Shinichi Izumi losing his humanity and emotional detachment" 
    loading="lazy"
  >

  <p>
    Parasyte: The Maxim explores a slow and unsettling erosion of humanity rather than
    a dramatic fall into villainy. Shinichi Izumi’s transformation is subtle,
    psychological, and deeply unsettling.
  </p>

  <p>
    After surviving a parasitic invasion that fuses an alien creature to his body,
    Shinichi is forced into constant life-or-death situations. Early on, he reacts
    with fear, guilt, and emotional vulnerability — clearly human reactions.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the series progresses, Shinichi becomes colder and more detached.
    He begins to lose emotional responses to death, violence, and even the suffering
    of those close to him. His increasing reliance on logic over emotion
    marks a terrifying shift.
  </p>

  <p>
    What makes Shinichi’s descent compelling is its realism.
    He doesn’t become evil — he becomes numb. The anime raises the question of whether
    survival at the cost of empathy is still humanity at all.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Episode count: 24</li>
    <li>Genre: Sci-Fi, Horror, Psychological</li>

    loading="lazy"
  >

  <p>
    Devilman Crybaby is not a story about power corrupting — it is a story about love
    being crushed by a cruel and unforgiving world. Akira Fudo begins as one of the
    most compassionate protagonists in anime.
  </p>

  <p>
    After merging with a demon to fight other demons, Akira retains his human heart.
    He cries for others, feels pain deeply, and desperately wants to protect humanity.
    Unlike most dark protagonists, Akira never loses his empathy willingly.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, the world around him descends into paranoia, hatred, and violence.
    Society collapses, trust evaporates, and fear turns humans into monsters.
    Akira’s goodness becomes a weakness in a world that no longer values it.
  </p>

  <p>
    As tragedy piles upon tragedy, Akira’s emotional suffering becomes unbearable.
    His transformation is not about becoming evil, but about losing innocence
    in a world that punishes kindness relentlessly.
  </p>

    loading="lazy"
  >

  <p>
    Moriarty the Patriot presents one of the most intellectual and morally complex
    descents into villainy in anime. William James Moriarty is not driven by madness,
    trauma, or corruption — he is driven by purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    Living in a society ruled by corrupt nobility, William witnesses systemic injustice
    where the rich exploit the poor without consequence. Rather than accepting this
    reality, he decides to become the very evil required to destroy it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike impulsive anti-heroes, Moriarty is cold, composed, and deliberate.
    Every crime he commits is calculated to expose the rot within society.
    He willingly embraces the role of a criminal mastermind, knowing history
    will label him a villain.
  </p>

  <p>
    What makes his descent compelling is that William never loses control.
    He sacrifices his own morality, reputation, and future for a greater ideal.
    His actions force the audience to question whether justice achieved through
    evil can still be considered justice at all.
  </p>

  <img

    alt="Vinland Saga anime showing Thorfinn consumed by hatred and revenge" 
    loading="lazy"
  >

  <p>
    Vinland Saga presents one of the most realistic portrayals of how vengeance
    slowly destroys a person from the inside. Thorfinn begins as an innocent child
    with dreams of adventure and honor.
  </p>

  <p>
    After witnessing the brutal murder of his father, Thorfinn’s life becomes defined
    by rage. He dedicates himself entirely to revenge, abandoning morality, empathy,
    and personal growth in pursuit of a single goal.
  </p>

  <p>
    What makes Thorfinn’s descent so painful is how empty it becomes.
    Years pass, battles are fought, lives are taken — yet nothing fills the void.
    His identity erodes until revenge is the only thing keeping him alive.
  </p>

  <p>
    Season 1 shows Thorfinn becoming increasingly hollow, emotionally numb,
    and violent. The anime does not glorify his actions. Instead, it exposes the cost
    of living without purpose beyond hatred.
  </p>

  >

  <p>
    Talentless Nana subverts expectations by placing the villain at the center of the story.
    Nana Hiiragi appears cheerful, kind, and heroic — but beneath that facade lies a trained
    assassin carrying out systematic murder.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nana believes she is saving humanity by eliminating individuals deemed dangerous.
    She justifies her actions through loyalty to authority and a belief that sacrifice
    is necessary for peace.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the series progresses, cracks begin to form in Nana’s convictions.
    Emotional connections with her targets force her to confront the humanity
    she was taught to ignore. Guilt and doubt slowly creep in.
  </p>

  <p>
    Her descent is unique because it is quiet.
    Nana does not spiral into madness — she struggles internally, questioning whether
    the system she serves is truly just.

    loading="lazy"
  >

  <p>
    Fate/Zero is a brutal exploration of idealism colliding with reality.
    Nearly every major character begins with noble intentions, yet the war they
    participate in slowly strips away their humanity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kiritsugu Emiya, the central figure, believes that sacrificing the few to save
    the many is the only rational path to peace. His methods are ruthless, calculated,
    and emotionally detached.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the Holy Grail War unfolds, ideals collapse under the weight of consequence.
    Each character is forced to confront the truth that good intentions do not
    guarantee good outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fate/Zero stands out because it refuses to offer easy answers.
    Every choice has blood on it, and victory feels hollow.
    The anime leaves viewers questioning whether heroism can exist in a world
    built on sacrifice.
